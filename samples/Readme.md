# Sample projects

This directory contains a variety of sample projects showing the minimal configuration required to setup mod.io on different platforms. In every directory you will find a guide that shows how to setup, compile and run the projects and a `Makefile` showing the configuration needed. If you want a more detailed explanation please follow our [Getting Started](https://github.com/DBolical/modioSDK/wiki/Getting-Started) documentation.
